          <p>
            I am a software engineer. I graduated Flatiron School in February
            2022. I build fullstack web apps in <strong>React</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving difficult problems (in teams and solo) and learning
            new tools and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before my foray into software engineering, I spent 8 years in
            digital marketing.

            Originally from Ireland, I now live in northern California with my
            husband, two cats, and innumerable plants.
