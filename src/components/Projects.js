            Users can search for Pokemon, see their types, and add Pokemon to
            their team. They can also see the specific strengths and weakness of
            the Pokemon on their team.

          <p>
            This is an updated version of my very first coding project. The
            original was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and
            Bootstrap. It had a local backend using json-server.
          </p>

          <p>
            This version uses a React frontend, with Redux for state management.
            It is styled with Bootstrap and customized with SCSS/SASS. It is
            deployed on AWS.

            We used React and Ruby on Rails to create a cocktail recommendation
            web app. Users can login and add their ingredients to see what
            cocktails they can currently make. They can view the full list of
            cocktails, see what ingredients they need and add ratings.
