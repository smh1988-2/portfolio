          A social podcast app. Users can sign up and find the podcasts they
          like, subscribe, and listen to episodes. They can rate podcasts and
          individual episodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users have a timeline of all their podcast activity, including what
          episodes they've listened to and when, as well as any subscriptions or
          ratings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can also follow other users. When you follow other users you can
          see their podcast activity in your timeline, including ratings and
          listening activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The app also tracks podcast listening metrics. You can see how many
          podcasts you're subscribed to, how many episodes you've listened to
          and how many hours of podcasts you've listened to.

            This is a landing page for a fake pretzel company. I wanted to build
            a simple landing page with vanilla (and semantic) HTML/CSS and no
            Javascript. The landing page is mobile-first and completely
            responsive, built with flexbox.
          </p>

          <p>The page is currently hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
